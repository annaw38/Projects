# Movie Timer App 
This app finds the shortest duration movie and movies between a specific interval inputted by the user. This app utilizes a 
Red-Black Tree data structure to organize the movies based on the duration of the movie and the movie's title. The data is
loaded from a local file that the user specifies.
